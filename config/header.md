This curated list contains {project_count} awesome open-source projects with a total of {stars_count} stars grouped into {category_count} categories. All projects are ranked by a [project-quality score](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of-generator#project-quality-score), which is calculated based on various metrics automatically collected from GitHub and different package managers. If you like to add or update projects, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/best-of-atomistic-machine-learning/issues/new/choose), submit a [pull request](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/best-of-atomistic-machine-learning/pulls), or directly edit the [projects.yaml](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/best-of-atomistic-machine-learning/edit/main/projects.yaml).

The current focus of this list is more on simulation data rather than experimental data, and more on materials rather than molecules. Nevertheless, contributions from other fields are warmly welcome!
