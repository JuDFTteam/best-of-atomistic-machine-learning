  # Style guide / guidelines for list best-of-atomistic-machine-learning (this list).
  #
  # - Use the simple template for projects and resources.
  # - Putting property values in quotes is mostly not needed, see examples below.
  # - Resources are those that don't have a repo (github_id etc.). See examples below.
  # - URLs: The project link in the README.md will point to link in prop, in order:
  #   homepage, docs_url, one of {github_id, gitlab_id, etc., whichever provided}.
  #   In most cases, only provide the repo_id URL. Cause it usually point to
  #   the other URLs, while the latter don't always point to the repo. If the other
  #   URLs exist, but the repo doesn't point to them, add them as props, but comment
  #   them out. See examples below.
  # - If a project is a subfolder of a repo, provide both props homepage (link to the repo
  #   subfolder containing the project) and the repo id (e.g., github_id). See example
  #   project DM21 below. That way, the project quality score is calculuated, and the
  #   project link points to the correct location. Don't set resource: true.
  # - Category & labels: Every category has a corresponding label, not every label has a
  #   corresponding category. View the category as the emphasized label. Labels / tags are
  #   generally preferred over tree-based classification (in this case, categories, one-
  #   dimensional). So, be generous with labeling. The label selected as category should
  # - If the repo_id's project description is missing or unhelpful, add description prop.
  #   Prefer to copy headline oneliner from project's README, if useful. If the project is
  #   tied to a preprint or paper and the repo README doesn't point to it, append the DOI
  #   link to the description.
  # - You can use groups props (group_id = group definition, group = group association)
  #   for keeping track of related projects (eg all from same devlopers; though that
  #   is usually clear from the repo_id parent folder.) However, comment them out, because
  #   they might interfer when grouped projects are in different categories (I think).
  # - If a project's category is changed, view this as emphasized label change.
  #   Consequently, add the old category as label, if not incorrect.
